# LeetCode

Personal archive of JavaScript solutions to LeetCode problems. Each file
contains a standalone solution along with any helper data structures needed
for that specific challenge. Feel free to borrow my solutions :)

## Repository layout

- `0-100/`, `101-200/`, `201-300/`, … – folders grouped by the LeetCode
  problem number range.
- Files follow the pattern `123.ProblemName.js` so they stay sorted and are
  easy to search inside an editor.

Happy coding!
